# Stats-Methods

It's a repository consists of summary of key methods and projects from previous stats courses, and grammars of some packages of R.

Including codes(R) and methods summary regarding data visualization, data wrangling, stochastic simulation, basic statistical inference and regression, statistical inference based on simulation and the bootstrap, numerical optimization, and machine learning(still R).

Blocks including: 
Introduction to Simulation: Random number generation; Probability simulations and CLT; Monte Carlo integration

Data Visualization:
Graphics, Choropleth maps and heat maps, Time series plots

Visualization of multivariate data:
Data Wrangling(dplyr package); Using the pipe operator as an alternative to function composition; 

Statistical Inference; Simple and Multiple Linear Regression Models; 

Stochastic Simulation:
Monte Carlo methods
The bootstrap
Permutation tests

Numerical Optimization of R:
R packages for Linear Programming and Nonlinear Optimization
Application to Numerical MLE and Simulation-Based Optimization

ML-based methods in R:
